One of the foundational elements of Node JS:- Modules.

When Node was created, at that time, there was no proper way to write modular code in javascript.
So Node team created their own way. They called it Modules in Node JS. In fact modules are a new feature for javascript in ES6.

-------
MODULES - A reusable block of code, whose existence does not accidenly impact other code. 
Node JS uses Common JS modCles- that just means an agreed upon standard for how code modules should be structured.

In node js a module is just a simple javascript file (.js).
