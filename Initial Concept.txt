Hello People,

So what is the idea behind Node JS.
It is simple.

We already had the v8 Javascript engine that was used by the browsers.
So, the same v8 engine was put at the core and its functionalities were extended by c++ wrapper code. Giving it the power of running on operating systems as a backend.


Google's v8 engine is open source. Can be looked at and can even be changed for ur own purposes.

v8 javascript engine is written in C++ and is used in google chrome.

v8 implements the ecmascript standard.

So v8 can run on different machines and hence support different machine codes. ia-32, arm64, x64, x87 etc etc...
So, if u go in the src folder for v8, you will see different folders by these names and that means they have implemented the ecmascript
specifcation for each of these macines.

This is the engine that will read the text of javascript and convert it into machine code.
Most of the files are .cc and .h c++ files.

v8 is huge and it has been worked on for years. Its fast adn its highly performant.

Adding features to javascript  ===== Using v8 in my c++ program ...
 ****** ALSO v8 can run standalone or can be embedded into any C++ application !!!!
There is an entire Embedder's guide for embdding v8 into a C++ program ====> And this path leads us to NODE JS.
v8 has hooks that I can use in my c++ program.
So I can use hooks to add features to the javascript programming language. AS SIMPLE AS THAT.
ONE OF THE v8 HOOKS allows me to  bind my c++ functions to english phrases. And hence expand the vocabulary of javascript. 
==============
THIS IS EXTRA-ORDINARILY POWERFUL.
Because....

C++ is way more powerful than the javascript programmign language.
Javascript was designed to be in the browser. It wasn't designed to deal with lower level operation like.. delaing with files or folders
sittin gin ur hard-drive or connecting directly to a database.
C++ was designed to that.  It was designed closer to the machine. 

So effectively, when i embed the v8 engine in my c++ program, I can make available the power of c++ to v8 and hence to javascript.

================
So Node JS is just a c++ program that has embedded v8 engine and has extended the capabilities of it using c++.
This was done by a compay named- Joyent.

=========== So, what does javascript needs to become Node:-

1. Better ways to reorganize our code into reusable pieces.

2. Ways to deal with files, databases and communicate over the internet.

3. THe ability to accept requests and send responses

4. A way to deal with work that takes a long time.
