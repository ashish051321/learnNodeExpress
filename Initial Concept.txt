Hello People,

So what is the idea behind Node JS.
It is simple.

We already had the v8 Javascript engine that was used by the browsers.
So, the same v8 engine was put at the core and its functionalities were extended by c++ wrapper code. Giving it the power of running on operating systems as a backend.

=========== So, what does javascript needs to become a web server:-

1. Better ways to reorganize our code into reusable pieces.

2. Ways to deal with files, databases and communicate over the internet.

3. THe ability to accept requests and send responses

4. A way to deal with work that takes a long time.

=================

Google's v8 engine is open source. Can be looked at and can even be changed for ur own purposes.

v8 javascript engine is written in C++ and is used in google chrome.

v8 implements the ecmascript standard.

So v8 can run on different machines and hence support different machine codes. ia-32, arm64, x64, x87 etc etc...
So, if u go in the src folder for v8, you will see different folders by these names and that means they have implemented the ecmascript
specifcation for each of these macines.

This is the engine that will read the text of javascript and convert it into machine code.
Most of the files are .cc and .h c++ files.

v8 is huge and it has been worked on for years. Its fast adn its highly performant.

 ****** ALSO v8 can run standalone or can be embedded into any C++ application !!!!
There is an entire Embedder's guide for embdding v8 into a C++ program ====> And this path leads us to NODE JS.
