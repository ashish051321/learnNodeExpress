Hello People,

So what is the idea behind Node JS.
It is simple.

We already had the v8 Javascript engine that was used by the browsers.
So, the same v8 engine was put at the core and its functionalities were extended by c++ wrapper code. Giving it the power of running on operating systems as a backend.

=========== So, what does javascript needs to become a web server:-

1. Better ways to reorganize our code into reusable pieces.

2. Ways to deal with files, databases and communicate over the internet.

3. THe ability to accept requests and send responses

4. A way to deal with work that takes a long time.
